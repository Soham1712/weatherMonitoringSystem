# weatherMonitoringSystem
 
In this project, we have proposed an IOT and cloud based Weather Monitoring Sys-
tem. The aim of weather monitoring system is to detect, record and display weather
parameters such as temperature ,humidity and contents of harmful gases. This system
makes use of sensors for detecting and monitoring weather parameters and then this
collected information is sent to the cloud which can be accessed using the internet.
The data displayed as an output can be observed and forecasted.The system engages a
Raspberry PI , DHT-11 sensor, MQ -135 sensor, MQ-7 sensor, MQ-9 sensor and sends
data to cloud computing services. A web page is also created which exhibits the data
and displays it to users.
